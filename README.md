# LiveMetaDecks
Software for using a single APC40 (and other midi hardware) to control TWO instances of Ableton Live so you can go back and forth (as if they were two virtual turntables)

Unfortunately this project is incomplete and in a (very) rough draft state. I abandoned this project when Ableton released the Push device which is superior to what I was trying to do with this project.
